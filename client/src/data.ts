    description: "Chronicles Sam Altman's rise from Y Combinator wunderkind to the guy most associated with kickstarting the AI boom. What makes it work is that Hagey doesn't frame him as either Bond villain or savior, but as a prism: tilt one way and he's a techno-messiah, tilt another and he's just a Valley operator playing the game harder than anyone else. It's not worship and it's not a hit piece, more like an X-ray of someone who genuinely believes the future can be hacked into existence, even if the rest of the world isn't sure that's comforting."
